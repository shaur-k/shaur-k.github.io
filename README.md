# Reactified version of the shaur-k website
This is my portfolio website! Rebuild using React (it looked horrible before).

## Future work
While this is currently just a portfolio website, I'm working on adding a blog subdomain in the near future.

Idk what else really matters for this README, you can run it locally with:
```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
